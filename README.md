this is the very first iphone app I ever created.
I have added this to github long after actually finishing the project<br>
so it's not the best of my coding and I have learned a lot since making this project<br><br>


the main purpose of this app is to learn how to make iphone apps as well as implement what at the time were
more advanced coding concepts like authentication and databases.<br><br>

I decided to take it one step further by implementing google authentication rather than standard auth<br>
believe it or not I thought it would be easier.<br><Br>

I used google's firebase firestore for the database bause to be honest it just looked cool<br><br>

for more info on firebase and google authentication see the [firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
